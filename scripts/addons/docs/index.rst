==========================================

This site serves as an introduction to Fabex, a free and open source extension for Blender, the free and open-source 3D app.
Fabex allows you to generate toolpaths and gcode files based on 3D objects or 2D Images within Blender.
These files can then be sent to a CNC machine to cut your designs!
